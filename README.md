# MIT_808_Streamlit
Streamlit deployment for MIT 808

Clone the Git Repo: MIT-808-Streamlit using the following command:
```
1 $git repo clone lesego94 / MIT_808_Streamlit
```
Note, that you must have Git installed to run this command, alternatively the repo can be downloaded as a zip file. However, Python3.9 must be installed to be able to run the App. Once the repo is downloaded or cloned on your local PC, open the “Streamlit” folder and double click on the “start app.bat” file. This will launch the command window and execute the necessary commands to install the necessary packages to run the App. Once that is done, it will launch your browser and run locally on “localhost:8501” and you will then have access to the interface presented below.
